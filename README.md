# Cat Shop

## Project Overview
The Cat Shop project is a Python-based simulation where users can browse and purchase cats based on various attributes, such as breed, color, age, weight, and gender. The application allows users to filter and select cats from a catalog, manage their budget, and generate a receipt after each purchase.

The program uses a combination of Python libraries to provide a user-friendly, interactive experience, processing inputs and displaying results accordingly.

## Features
- **Cat Catalog**: Displays available cat breeds with prices.
- **User Preferences**: Allows users to specify preferences like breed, color, age, weight, and gender.
- **Cat Search and Filtering**: Filters cats based on the user’s input.
- **Budget Management**: Tracks the user’s budget and updates it after a purchase.
- **Receipt Generation**: Generates a receipt after a purchase, displaying details about the cat and the remaining budget.

## Pros
- **Interactive Experience**: The application prompts the user for input and provides a real-time catalog of available cats.
- **Flexible Filtering**: Users can filter available cats by breed, color, gender, age, and weight.
- **Simple to Use**: With minimal setup, the user can start browsing and shopping for cats right away.
- **Budget Tracking**: The app ensures the user stays within their budget, with real-time updates on remaining funds.
- **Receipt Generation**: A receipt is created with a breakdown of the purchase and the remaining balance.

## Cons
- **Hardcoded Data**: The available cat breeds and prices are hardcoded in the application.
- **No Real Transaction**: This is a simulation and does not involve actual financial transactions.
- **Limited Interface**: The interaction is text-based, without a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Basic Error Handling**: While the app validates inputs, additional error handling and user experience features could be added.

## How It Works
1. **Introduction**: The user is greeted with their budget and a catalog of cats.
2. **User Input**: The user provides information about their desired cat, including breed, color, gender, age, and weight.
3. **Filtering**: The application filters the catalog of cats based on the user's preferences and displays matching results.
4. **Purchase and Checkout**: The user can select a cat, add it to their basket, and proceed to checkout. The remaining budget is displayed after each purchase.
5. **Receipt Generation**: After a purchase, the user is prompted to generate a receipt for their transaction.
6. **Retry or Exit**: After completing a purchase, the user can either continue shopping or exit the program.
